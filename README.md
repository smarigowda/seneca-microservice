# A Mono Repo for Seneca Micro Services

## Pre-requisite

- Install Lerna globally and initailize lerna.

  ```
  npm install -g lerna

  lerna init
  ```

- Configure lerna to use yarn as npmClient.

- Setup Yarn Workspaces. (instruction are @ link below)

## Notes:

- Use selective depencency resolution if required.

- Run commands using `yarn workspace`

```
yarn workspace math-service run start
```

## Math Service

Run the service.

```
cd packages/math-service
node math-service.js
```

Test the service.

```
curl -d '{ "service":"math", "command":"sum", "data": { "left": 1, "right": 2 } }' http://localhost:10101/act
```

## Seneca Notes:

- With Seneca, you build up your system by defining a set of patterns that correspond to messages. You organize these patterns into plugins to make logging and debugging easier. You then combine one or more plugins into microservices.

- Plugins often need to do some initialization work, such as connecting to a database. You don’t do this work in the body of the plugin definition function. The definition function is synchronous by design, because all it does is define the plugin. In fact, you should not call seneca.act at all in the plugin definition - call seneca.add only.

- Initialization function must complete before any actions can be performed. If it fails, the whole service fails to initialize.

- The more specific pattern always wins. In other words, the pattern with the highest number of matching attributes has precedence.

- You can chain .add and .act calls together

- The ability to easily extend the behavior of your actions by matching more specific kinds of messages is an easy way to handle new and changing requirements. This applies both while your project is in development and when it is live and needs to adapt. It also has the advantage that you do not need to modify existing code. It’s much safer to add new code to handle special cases. In a production system, you won’t even need to do a re-deploy. Your existing services can stay running as they are. All you need to do is start up your new service.

- Code reuse: Action patterns can call other action patterns to do their work.

- The patterns resolve using the following rules:

  - More properties win
  - If the patterns have the same number of properties, they are matched in alphabetical order

- With Seneca, you create microservices by calling `seneca.listen` and you talk to the services using `seneca.client`

# Commands:

```
node minimal-plugin.js  --seneca.log.info | grep plugin
node minimal-plugin.js  --seneca.log.all | grep plugin | grep DEFINE
```
